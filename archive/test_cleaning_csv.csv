ANES 395,https://catalog.byu.edu/courses/11184-000,Junior Seminar in Ancient Near Eastern Studies,International and Area Studies,Kennedy Center for International Studies,1,Research Design and Analysis,"The primary focus of this course will be to provide students with an opportunity to conduct in-depth research in an area of their specialty within the ANES major. To accomplish this, students will plan, research, write, revise, and rewrite a paper of 12–15 pages on a topic of their choice that will demonstrate their familiarity with the discipline of Ancient Near Eastern Studies and their potential to produce original scholarly contributions within the field. This paper will also demonstrate their ability to interpret and analyze relevant primary sources, their proficiency in the relevant ancient languages, and their capacity for critical thinking.

This will be encouraged through a series of readings and discussions relating to such issues as achieving work-life balance, dealing with “imposter syndrome,” and experiencing faith transitions in the process of pursuing higher education. The latter topic in particular will be considered by surveying the encounter of faith traditions and higher biblical criticism (including among Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant scholars), the history of Latter-day Saint engagement with biblical scholarship, and the journey of becoming a “disciple-scholar.” It is hoped that this aspect of the course will provide students with resources, tools, and perspectives that will help them navigate the rigors of academic life while maintaining a healthy framework for their personal and spiritual lives."

Many of these skills will draw on the student&rsquo;s knowledge of music theory and become the concrete application of that knowledge.As keyboard players &ndash;they &nbsp;are expected to have the strongest working knowledge of harmony, as&nbsp;the instrument is polyphonic in nature &ndash; not homophonic. &nbsp;The ability to see many notes and instantly divide them into harmonic groupings is crucial and a common denominator for nearly every aspect of this class.&nbsp; Sometimes this grouping skill will include adding or subtracting notes from the page, or supplying notes that are only notated by a symbol.&nbsp;Very often students can play their performance repertoire wonderfully, but are virtually helpless and intimidated when attempting to add or subtract some of their own notes when not written specifically on the page. This tendency represents incomplete musicianship - it is instead only well trained muscles.&nbsp;The outcomes for this course include sight reading, modulation, score reading, figured bass, transposition and improvisation.&nbsp;&nbsp; After discussing other items that would be considered foundational material for keyboard players in 2012, it was decided that added emphasis would be given to the history of great pianists.&nbsp;"
