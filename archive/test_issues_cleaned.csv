It is a first course in abstract algebra. In addition to being an important branch of mathematics in its own right, abstract algebra is now an essential tool in number theory, geometry, topology, and, to a lesser extent, analysis. Thus it is a core requirement for all mathematics majors. Outside of mathematics, algebra also has applications in cryptography, coding theory, quantum chemistry, and physics.
