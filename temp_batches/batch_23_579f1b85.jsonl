The Global and Cultural Awareness requirement enhances that awareness with a greater understanding and appreciation of the varieties of human experience across time and space. Inherent in the notion of global and cultural awareness is the perspective that we are all spiritual offspring of the same God, that in addition to our common humanity we also possess a nascent divinity. The Global and Cultural Awareness requirement seeks to help BYU students come not only to see the relativity of many of their own, culturally-derived notions but also to go forth to serve, having had meaningful discussion about or hands-on experience in dealing with real world global issues and problems. 1. Students will acquire informed awareness of either a) a culture outside their own, or b) the interplay of cultures, languages, and/or nations at an international level. 2. Students will experience thoughtful reflection on the above, as demonstrated in a structured, guided manner under the direction of a faculty member. Evidence of reflection implies written or spoke analysis that will include a consideration of the student\u201a??s own responses to the culture or global issue, often involving comparison, and will demonstrate informed awareness. 3. Students will develop greater empathy and charity, and begin to gain a global perspective, by learning to see themselves from another\u201a??s point of view. \""}]}}
