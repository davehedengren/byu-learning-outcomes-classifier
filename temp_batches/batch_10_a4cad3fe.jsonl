Students will understand how governments, international governmental organizations (IGOs), international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and other institutions create as right-holders can create educational opportunities and support educational systems that develop leadership and foster learning and creativity for all people. These questions and other outcomes explored in this course will enable students to: Introduce students to the complexities of the reservoir of diverse intellectual ideas and traditions in education; Articulate these understandings in making more thoughtful, responsible and better informed decisions in their own research and practice, and in their own reading and use of research in the field; Understand issues of equity and equality of educational opportunities and outcomes for differently situated social groups, especially those who historically have been most discriminated against; Synthesize the knowledge and discussions regarding the concept of education in poverty and human development, so as to inform their definition, draw on the extensive policy and academic literatures available to propose relationships between the multidemsionalities of poverty and five related concepts: educational poverty, rights in education and right to education, human rights, and well-being and happiness; Acquire a critical methodology that should prepare students for second cycle studies as well as for making contribution as mid-level policy-makers in agencies or practitioners in NGOs."}]}}
