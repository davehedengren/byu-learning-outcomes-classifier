Assessment of Mathematics Learning Students understand how to design and use formative and summative assessments that monitor the learner's progress, inform instructional decisions, and engage adolescents in assessing their own mathematical learning. Professionalism Students demonstrate their professionalism through maintaining appropriate relationships and behavior in the school setting, and by seeking opportunities to improve practice and advance the profession through reflecting on practice, soliciting and incorporating feedback, and contributing to professional, school, and community organizations. Spiritual StewardshipStudents seek integrity between their personal and professional lives consistent with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ by recognizing all learners as children of God and striving to nurture their divine potential; applying gospel-centered principles of teaching and learning to family relationships, gospel service, and involvement in the community; and serving as examples of a Christ-centered life within their spheres of influence."}]}}
